# adventofcode-2015

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2015 Challenges (https://adventofcode.com/).

* All of them is written with Python 2.7
* All of them are unique solutions that was not done with any peeking on existing ones, there are few exceptions though when I hopelessly got stuck and I went to the Reddit page of solutions to see how people approached the problem
* Many of them take parameters (like the input file to read, or how many cycles to execute, etc...), earlier ones have these hard-coded (I might be rewriting them, not sure)
* Some of them provide visual representation of the problem (maybe there is code inside but switched off)
* Some of them may be not optimal, but they finish on time, some of them are really quick though

## DAY 10
* Part1 I used the itertools groupby function
* Part2 that proved to be slow (it finished in 10 minutes though), but a rewrite to a naive algorithm is much faster

## DAY 11
* It is worth doing all the mentioned optimizations as it will help getting an answer

## DAY 12

## DAY 13

## DAY 14
* Part1 was tricky as the time ticks can be implemented in various ways, and the example is not helping to test if it is OK or not

## DAY 15
* Part1 was tricky because of the input data, some approaches became unfeasible
